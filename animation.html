        The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.
        
            The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:
            ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
            linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
            ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
            ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
            ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
            cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
